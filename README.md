# Blazor Project

Web application written using the Blazor WebAssembly framework, as a homework assignment in Social Science Academy.

## Main changes 
The main changes are as follows:

- Home page styled.
- Counter reversal and warning added.
- Todo List created.
- Changed NavMenu.
- Reusable InfoMessage added in "./Test/Shared/InfoMessage.razor".

## Known issues

Upon initiating the application on my Linux machine with the command `dotnet watch run`, the NavMenu is not displayed. This differs from the behaviour observed when the application is initiated on Windows 11 with Visual Studio, where the NavMenu is displayed as expected.  
On Linux, tested with LibreWolf and Chromium browsers, the result remains the same.
